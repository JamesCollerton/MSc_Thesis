This directory contains all of the code used in the analysis of Nutonian
Eureqa. There are three folders:

1. Generating Basic Tests: These are the basic testing functions written in R.
   						   Contained within this file is the code to generate
   						   the tests, images of the output and also to overlay 
   						   the Eureqa derived plots on top.

2. The Pratt and Planque Original Models: These are the Pratt and Planque models as
								 		  written in Python. Contained within this file
								 		  is the Python code to generate the model data
								 		  with both fixed and variable parameters.

3. The Pratt and Planque Eureqa models: These are the Pratt and Planque models as
										generated by Eureqa, and are written in language
										R. Included within these files is the code to
										run the models, as well as to compare the 
										original and Eureqa derived solutions.

NOTE: SPECIFYING RELATIVE DIRECTORIES IN R IS DIFFICULT AND SYSTEM DEPENDENT.

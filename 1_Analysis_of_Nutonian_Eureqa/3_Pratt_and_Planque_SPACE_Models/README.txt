- Source Code for MSc Thesis

The source code for the Pratt and Planque tests is split into the data and the
the scripts to run the analysis. The scripts to run the analysis have been 
commented, but are fairly similar, so some are more well covered than others.
By starting at Pratt_Q1 they should be the most readable.

NOTE: SPECIFYING RELATIVE DIRECTORIES IN R IS DIFFICULT AND SYSTEM DEPENDENT.
	  SOME CODE MAY REQUIRE YOU TO CHANGE THE CURRENT DIRECTORY BEFORE RUNNING.

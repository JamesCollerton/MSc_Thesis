# MSc_Thesis

Final submission code from my MSc Thesis. The other repository (in my desperation) got pretty messy!

My thesis was based around the question 'Is it possible to use genetic algorithms to automatically infer differential equation systems modelling the emigration of temnothorax albipennis ants between nests?". The thesis came to a quite interesting conclusion relating the level of complexity of equations to the 
stability of the differential equation models derived.

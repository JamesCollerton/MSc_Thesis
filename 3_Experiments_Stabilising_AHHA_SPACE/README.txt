This directory contains all of the code for the experiments on stabilising the
SPACE differential equation model.

1. ODE_Parameter_Stabilisation: This is the experiment involving the stabilisation
								of the model using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
								and parameter optimisation. Written in language R.

2. Iterative_Stabilisation: The code for the experimentation involving 
							the stabilisation of the SPACE model using a
							iterative method is contained within this folder.
							Written in language R.

3. Brute_Force_Stabilisation: Contained within this folder is all of the code
							  necessary for the system devised to stabilise the SPACE
							  model using the brute force technique. This is significantly
							  more complex than the other files, but is explained in the
							  folder.

							  Also, I affectionately named the system DED SPACE 
							  (Differential Equation Discovery for SPACE).

NOTE: SPECIFYING RELATIVE DIRECTORIES IN R IS DIFFICULT AND SYSTEM DEPENDENT.

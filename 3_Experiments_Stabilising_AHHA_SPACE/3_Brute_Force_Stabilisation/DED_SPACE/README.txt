- Source Code for MSc Thesis

This is the source code for the brute force approach to stabilising the SPACE
model. It is split into the main parts:

Data: This is the training data for the system.

Output_Files: These are the output files for the models generated by the system.

Results: Output from a connection to the Eureqa API is a set of results, this
		 is stored here to be later parsed by another script.

Example_Result: This is the result from the thesis that minimises the error. You
				can use it with the combining_results.py script.

Scripts:
	
	basic_client: This is a C++ script for connecting to the Eureqa server
				  through the Eureqa API. Within this script we connect to the
				  server, feed in the training data, specify the output form and
				  gather the results.

				  Requirements: This needs the Eureqa API libraries, which are
				  				contained and linked within the submission. Some
				  				work might possibly be needed to have them work 
				  				correctly with the code. Bash scripts have been
				  				included to try and automate this process. 

	combining_results: This is a Python script which takes in the results.txt
					   file generated by the Eureqa API and turns it into all
					   possible differential equation models as derived by Eureqa.
					   The one with the best fit is then kept and used as our 
					   final model.

	plotting_results: This is another Python script, which takes the results.txt
					  file and composes the model with the optimal level of error
					  and complexity. It is used to compare what we would have
					  recieved using the original method, as opposed to the brute
					  force approach.

NOTES: Each of these scripts must be run in sequence. Bash scripts are provided
to try and automate this process, but some reworking may still be necessary.
